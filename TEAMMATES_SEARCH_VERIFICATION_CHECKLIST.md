- [x] In-memory operations efficient (O(page size))

### Security
- [x] [Authorize] attribute on controller

### API Contract
- [x] Endpoint: GET /api/teammates

- [x] Response schema documented
- [x] Status codes specified (200, 400, 401, 429, 500)
- [x] OpenAPI definition complete
- [x] Scalar /docs accessible

### Error Handling
- [x] Empty results handled gracefully
- [x] Presence service failures propagated
- [x] Invalid user ID returns 401
- [x] Rate limit exceeded returns 429
- [x] Exceptions wrapped in ProblemDetails

### Documentation
- [x] Repository layer documented
- [x] Service layer documented
- [x] WebAPI layer documented
- [x] Complete summary created
- [x] Commit message prepared
- [x] Inline code comments for complex logic

## ?? Manual Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] GET /api/teammates (no filters) returns results
- [ ] GET /api/teammates?size=10 respects page size
- [ ] GET /api/teammates?gameId={id} filters by game
- [ ] GET /api/teammates?university=MIT filters by university
- [ ] GET /api/teammates?skill=2 filters by skill level
- [ ] GET /api/teammates?onlineOnly=true shows only online users
- [ ] Multiple filters work together

### Pagination
- [ ] First page returns NextCursor
- [ ] NextCursor retrieves second page without duplicates
- [ ] Empty cursor returns first page
- [ ] Invalid cursor returns 400

### Authentication
- [ ] Missing token returns 401
- [ ] Invalid token returns 401
- [ ] Expired token returns 401
- [ ] Valid token returns 200

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Send 120 requests ? all succeed
- [ ] Send 121st request ? returns 429
- [ ] Wait 1 minute ? new requests succeed
- [ ] Rate limit is per user (different users independent)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No results (empty university) returns empty Items array
- [ ] CurrentUserId not in results (excluded correctly)
- [ ] Soft-deleted users not in results
- [ ] Invalid GameId returns empty results (not error)

### Performance
- [ ] Response time < 100ms for 20 results
- [ ] Response time < 200ms for 100 results
- [ ] No timeout errors for typical queries

---

## ?? Metrics to Monitor (Post-Deployment)

### Response Times
- [ ] p50 < 100ms
- [ ] p95 < 200ms
- [ ] p99 < 500ms

### Throughput
- [ ] Handles > 100 requests/sec per instance
- [ ] No error rate increase under load

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] 429 responses logged appropriately
- [ ] Rate limit resets after 1 minute

### Database
- [ ] Index usage confirmed (no seq scans in EXPLAIN)
- [ ] Query execution time < 50ms
- [ ] No connection pool exhaustion

### Redis
- [ ] Presence checks < 10ms
- [ ] Single pipeline per request (verify with Redis MONITOR)
- [ ] No connection errors

---

## ?? Deployment Steps

### Pre-Deployment
1. [ ] Merge feature branch to master
2. [ ] Review all changed files
3. [ ] Run full test suite (when implemented)
4. [ ] Build release configuration

### Deployment
1. [ ] Deploy to staging environment
2. [ ] Run database migration: `dotnet ef database update`
3. [ ] Verify indexes created: `\d users`, `\d user_games` (PostgreSQL)
4. [ ] Restart application
5. [ ] Smoke test: GET /api/teammates
6. [ ] Check logs for errors

### Post-Deployment
1. [ ] Monitor response times (first 5 minutes)
2. [ ] Monitor error rates
3. [ ] Test from client application
4. [ ] Verify /docs displays new endpoint

## ?? Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized
**Cause:** Missing or invalid JWT token  
**Solution:** Verify token in Authorization header: `Bearer {token}`

### Issue: 429 Too Many Requests
**Cause:** Rate limit exceeded  
**Solution:** Wait 1 minute or reduce request frequency

### Issue: Empty results when users exist
**Possible Causes:**
- User is soft-deleted (IsDeleted = true)
- User is currentUserId (excluded by design)
- Filters too restrictive (no matches)

### Issue: Slow response times
**Diagnosis:**
1. Check repository query time (should be < 50ms)
2. Check Redis response time (should be < 10ms)
3. Check for N+1 queries (should be none)
4. Verify indexes exist and are used

**Solutions:**
- If repository slow: Check indexes with EXPLAIN
- If Redis slow: Check network latency, connection pool
- If service slow: Profile sorting/mapping logic

### Issue: Duplicate results across pages
**Cause:** Data changed between requests (cursor jitter)  
**Expected Behavior:** Acceptable for ephemeral online status  
**If Persistent:** Check cursor encoding/decoding logic

---

## ?? Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. Cursor Jitter
**Symptom:** Online status changes may cause slight pagination inconsistencies  
**Workaround:** Accept as expected behavior for real-time data  
**Future Fix:** Implement session-based presence snapshots

### 2. PrevCursor Always Null
**Symptom:** Cannot paginate backwards  
**Workaround:** Use forward pagination only  
**Future Fix:** Implement reverse cursor logic in repository

### 3. SharedGames Computed Per Request
**Symptom:** May be slow if user has many games  
**Workaround:** Currently fast due to indexed queries  
**Future Fix:** Cache SharedGames if becomes bottleneck
